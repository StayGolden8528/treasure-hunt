# treasure-hunt
Simple Treasure Hunt Game using jQuery where the treasure is assigned randomly to coordinates on the map, and through click events you receive messages to let you know whether you are hot or cold until you find the treasure. It also counts the number of clicks it took the user to find the treasure.
